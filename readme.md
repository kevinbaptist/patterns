# Patterns
Patterns can be divided in three categories:
* Structural
* Creational
* Behavioural

# Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to have some key concepts in most used Patterns, as well as its use cases 
and implementation. This is a quick guide to revisit every once in a while.

This is not an in-depth analysis of the Patterns. For a more in depth analysis of those and other 
patterns I recommend: [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) and 
[Java Design Patterns](https://java-design-patterns.com/)
